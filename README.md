# Image Share

Image Share is a mock application that allows users to upload and sell images to other users.  This application is still a bit of a work in progress, but a deployed version is available.  

#### Caution: Any images that are uploaded will eventually be deleted by Heroku.  However, the images should be available for a few hours and will give the user enough time to get a feel for the application.

###Update 1/28/2023 - This project is no longer available on Heroku.  Users will need to clone the project and run it on their local.
